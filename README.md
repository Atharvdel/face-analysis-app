## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

**Frontend Architecture**: Single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript implementing asynchronous request handling and dynamic DOM manipulation for real-time user interactions.

**Backend Architecture**: Flask-based RESTful API server utilizing Google Gemini's vision-language model for multimodal image analysis and natural language generation.

**Deployment**: Serverless deployment on Vercel with automatic scaling and edge optimization for global content delivery.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (45.6%), JavaScript ES6+ (29.2%)
- **Backend**: Python Flask (19.4%) with asynchronous request handling
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API with vision-language processing
- **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding/decoding for client-server communication
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions with automatic CI/CD

## üîß Core Functionality

**Image Processing Pipeline**:
1. **Client-side preprocessing**: Image validation, compression, and base64 encoding
2. **Server-side analysis**: Flask endpoint receives multipart form data and processes through Gemini API
3. **AI inference**: Gemini's vision model analyzes facial geometry, symmetry, and aesthetic features
4. **Response generation**: Structured JSON response with categorical analysis and recommendations
