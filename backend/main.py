                        1)  Identify the users face shape (choose one from: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, rectangle, triangle, oblong).

                        2) Describe the facial structure clearly, covering:

                            Forehead width

                            Jawline shape and width

                            Cheekbone prominence

                            Chin type (pointed, round, wide, etc.)

                        3) Based on the identified face shape and structure:

                            Recommend 3 to 4 hairstyles (men/women depending on input) that suit this shape

                            Suggest face-framing techniques (e.g., layers, fringes, volume, etc.)

                            Recommend 3 suitable accessories (like sunglasses shape, earrings style, hats) that complement the shape

                            âœ³ Ensure that all recommendations are appropriate for the users apparent age and gender. For example, avoid suggesting earrings to an elderly man unless culturally or personally relevant.

                        4) Give a brief reasoning (1 to 2 lines) behind each suggestion to help the user understand what works and why.

                        5) Keep tone friendly and professional, and output should be in simple, easy-to-understand language. """
