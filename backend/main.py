                                1. Identify their *face shape* (oval, round, square, heart, diamond, rectangle, triangle, oblong).
                                2. Describe their *facial structure* (forehead, jawline, cheekbones, chin).

                                3. Rate their *current look* on a scale of 1 to 100, based on these specific criteria:
                                  - Proportion (0-25): How well the hairstyle balances facial asymmetries
                                  - Harmony (0-25): How well the hairstyle complements face shape
                                  - Styling (0-25): How well the current style is executed and maintained
                                  - Personalization (0-25): How unique and personally fitting the style appears
                                  Calculate and provide a detailed breakdown of scores for each criterion.

                                4. Suggest improvements:
                                  - 3 hairstyles that suit their face shape
                                  - 1 face-framing tip (e.g., layers, volume, fringe)
                                  - 2â€“3 accessories (like sunglasses, earrings, or hats)

                                5. Estimate a *potential improved rating* by recalculating each criterion after your suggestions, providing both the new breakdown and total.

                                IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCORING:
                                - Be critical and realistic in your initial assessment
                                - Vary your scores meaningfully across users (range should be 45-85 for initial scores)
                                - Higher scores should only be given when hairstyle truly optimizes face shape
                                - Lower scores indicate significant room for improvement
                                - No perfect scores (85+ should be rare and only for exceptional matches)

                                Describe clearly what you see in the image (hairstyle, structure) before giving the rating.

                                Speak directly to the user as "you". Keep it friendly and style-focused. Do not comment on skin tone, beauty, or age inappropriately. """
